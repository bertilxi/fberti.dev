      <h4>Profile</h4>
      <p>
        I am a software developer. I am willing to learn and improve the quality
        work that I do. I am flexible, pragmatic and a fast learner. I think the
        most important part of development is deliver added value and high
        quality solutions to the client. I enjoy the most the design and the
        management of projects. I like to work in a challenging environment and
        to learn new technologies. I have worked in different projects, with
        different technologies, frameworks and languages. So I have learned to
        adapt quickly. I like to be proactive and I enjoy leading and working as
        part of a team.
